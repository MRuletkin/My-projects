1. The most popular hypervisors used for virtualization infrastructure are Hyper-V, KVM (examples of type 1 hypervisors) and VMware (type 2 hypervisors)
2. Some comments about Hyper-V:
   1. You need to license all virtual machines running Windows.
   2. There is no graphical interface, however, there is a remote console.
   3. Lack of manufacturer support (but there are updates).
   Some comments about KVM:
   1. Open source solution
   2. Easy to use, lightweight, undemanding to resources and quite functional hypervisor
   3. Not the best stability when performing a variety of tasks with intensive input-output
   Some comments about VMware:
   1. The most expensive solution
   2. Great functionality
 These 3 hypervisors are the most suitable as enterprise-level solutions
